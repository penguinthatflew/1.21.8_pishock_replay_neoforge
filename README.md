A PiShock integration for Minecraft
=======
Used in a YouTube video by PenguinThatFlew. Unmaintained and relatively jank - fork at your own risk!

How do I get the same Replay Mod / PiShock setup that you had? 
============
Make an installation on Curseforge with:

Minecraft 1.21.8

Neoforge 21.8.52

Navigate to Releases and download the .jar files. Those are the same files I used and the ones you need.

Add those ,jar files into the mods folder of your Minecraft installation.

Make sure to change the values in the config, and you should be good to go!

I am not the first one to do this.

Much of this code was copied from [this](https://github.com/ojaha065/PiShockForMC/tree/main) older repo.

You can check out [Raith's PiShock integrations](https://jenkins.raith.one/) as well (I haven't tested these).

You can make something like this yourself by following [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG-oJPR_40w&list=PLKGarocXCE1G6CQOoiYdMVx-E1d9F_itF) tutorial on NeoForge from Kaupenjoe.
