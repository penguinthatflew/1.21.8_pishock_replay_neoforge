What
=======
A PiShock integration for Minecraft used in a YouTube video by PenguinThatFlew. 
Unmaintained and relatively jank - fork at your own risk!

How do I get the same Replay Mod / PiShock setup that you had? 
============
Navigate to Releases and download the .jar files. Those are the same files I used and the ones you need.

Make an installation on Curseforge with:

Minecraft 1.21.8

Neoforge 21.8.52

Make sure to change the values in the config, and you should be good to go

I am not the first one to do this.

Much of this code was copied from [this](https://github.com/ojaha065/PiShockForMC/tree/main) older repo.
You can make something like this yourself by following [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG-oJPR_40w&list=PLKGarocXCE1G6CQOoiYdMVx-E1d9F_itF) tutorial on NeoForge from Kaupenjoe.
