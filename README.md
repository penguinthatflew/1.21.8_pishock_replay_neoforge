I am not the first one to do this.

Much of this code was copied from [this](https://github.com/ojaha065/PiShockForMC/tree/main) older repo.
You can make something like this yourself by following [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yG-oJPR_40w&list=PLKGarocXCE1G6CQOoiYdMVx-E1d9F_itF) tutorial on NeoForge from Kaupenjoe.
